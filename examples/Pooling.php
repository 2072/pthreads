/*
* 	Pooling is the clever thing to do with threads ...
*	
*	Just like CallAnyFunction this is an extremely easy thing to implement in userspace, and control is retained over how the pool works ...
*	for this reason, pthreads doesn't include pooling in the API ...
*
*	We often think of a language as high or low level, PHP doesn't fit into either of those two categories very well
*	Lots of functions we're used to using in PHP are strikingly similar, if not exactly the same as their C counterparts, which gives it a low level feel ...
*	The threading API is similar to __insert_high_level_language__, but infact we are still in the middle. In both high and low level languages your threads share memory
*	The architecture we are executing in prohibits that from occuring, agressively ( it forms the thread safety used to execute in some SAPI's and indeed execute pthreads )
*	When a thread is started it is allocated a context, to allocate that context and throw it away after a file_get_contents or a few instructions is wasteful, especially
*	if the programmer knows they will soon need to execute another Thread.
*	pthreads includes a Worker Thread functionality, and this can be built upon in the user space to pool threads that you have created in order to reuse their contexts.
*	
*	I insist, give it a go ... this is less than 100 lines, and is mostly babbling ...
